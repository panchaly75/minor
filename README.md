Smart Saline Level Monitoring System

Intravenous injections have been widely used for treatment of patient for dehydration. In this process the patient is injected with saline for dehydration and other medical ailments to improve the health condition of the patients. When we feed the patient with saline, continuous observation of nurses is mandatory for monitoring the level of the saline. Moreover, there are many cases where patient discomfort has been observed due to staff inattentiveness. Hence we propose a design for smart saline level monitoring system which is an effective solution for the above problem. Our proposed model incorporates a circuit which continuously detects the saline level and alerts the staff.
